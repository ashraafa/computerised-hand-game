* ### Design
  * Wireframes
    During the design phase it was decided that a separate mobile design was not needed due to the number of page elements and available page space that was not going to be consumed.  The user stories were considered when designing the mock-ups.
 
  * Landing Page
    * The page was designed to be the resting place before the user starts the game.

      ![Landing Page](assets/images/landing-page-wf.png)

  * Game Display
    * The page was designed for the game controls that are displayed after the user clicks Play.

* Colour Palette
  * The color palette below was generated by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)
    * Dark Cornflower Blue was applied to the navigation buttons.
    * Big Dip Oruby was applied to the navigation buttons when hovered and focused.
    * Lemon Meringue for the background color of the game.

* Typography
  * The main font used by the game for headings is the "Luckiest Guy" with Cursive as the fallback font. This font was selected due the retro design and also that it was a perfect font name for the game being played.
  * This font is supported by Roboto for all other text with Sans-Serif as the fallback font.

## 5. Bug Fixes

| Bug | Solution |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| 1. When a game is a draw the reason is not displayed | Value for resultReason was missing in the calculateResult function |
| 2. Game score displays 0 but after winning the score increments to last won value | Updated the resetGameScore function to set the gameScoreWon and gameScoreLost value to 0 |
| 3. Result message not displaying the selected hand options  | Add data-type to icon since the attribute did not exist and therefore when user clicked the icon it would set the value as undefined |
| 4. JSHint gave warning "Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics" | Removed function from btn.eventListener when Play is clicked and created a separate event listener specifically for the Play button |
| 5. Close button on rules not displaying on smaller screens | Set the relative position for the rules close button |
| 6. HTML validator identified frameless border as being deprecated | Removed frameless border from iframe tag and set property in CSS instead |
| 7. Aria-label misuse warning from HTML validator | Removed aria-label from icon and set on game control button instead |
| 8. Video continues playing after display for video-wrapper is set to none | Created a function that resets iframe.src |
